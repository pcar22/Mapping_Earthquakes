# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to collect earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API and generate interactive maps that showcase earthquakes across the globe. The maps will depict the earthquake data in relation to the location of tectonic plates on earth, and will also display the magnitude of each event.  

The map provides a satellite view and displays the earthquakes from the past 7 days. Each earthquake is represented as a circle marker on the map, and clicking on a marker reveals a popup message indicating its magnitude and location.
