# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to have the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates location on the earth, and to show all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. The base challenge was to have have two maps, a third map was added per the request. 

The map is showing the earthquakes in the past 7 days. Each feature is a circle marker on the map, and if clicked a popup message will appear showing the magnitude and location.
